# qrpaper 

## Slogan
**Salute to Satoshi, qrpaper makes Bitcoin great forever !!!**

## Features
1. This is a **Bitcoin-native NFT**, distinct from other PFP projects that are copied from Ethereum.
2. Its core mission is to strengthen the consensus of Bitcoin, serving a **practical purpose**.
3. It has a **robust economic model**, capable of long-term and sustainable growth.

## Introduction
qrpaper is a project that helps crypto projects inscribe whitepaper on Bitcoin with 
**WhitePaper Sharding Technology**.

It converts the whitepaper into plain text format of markdown, and after splitting
it into sentences, encodes each sentence into a QR code, signs it, and inscribes 
it on Bitcoin with Ordinals Protocol for permanent storage.

## Significance
As the earliest blockchain, Bitcoin's value mainly comes from consensus, 
but it is also constantly facing challenges from other public chains. 

In order to consolidate the value of Bitcoin, we put forward the slogan 
**"Salute to Satoshi, every project should inscribe WhitePaper on Bitcoin"**. 

Which is not only conducive to continuously strengthening the consensus of Bitcoin, 
but also It is beneficial for new projects to be understood and accepted by Bitcoin users.

## qp-dao
People who holds the NFT of the three core qrpaper(bitcoin, ethereum and ordinals) 
will have the right to join. And you will have benifits like airdrop, whitelist, 
vote, reward and vip-role to read our crypto project research report.

## Economic
The core team consists of holders of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ordinals WhitePaper NFT, 
who conduct research on early-stage crypto projects, assist in the publish of 
WhitePaper NFTs, and provide support for promotion.

In return, these projects are expected to reward the core team with a portion of 
airdrops, whitelist, project tokens, etc.

Non-core members holding NFTs from other projects will receive OG-role (Original Gangster)
in those projects and will receive ongoing rewards from the respective projects.

## RoadMap
1. Publish the three core qrpaper(bitcoin, ethereum and ordinals) 
2. Build qp-dao and the core team to do crypto project research
3. Help other crypto project to publish whitepaper on bitcoin 
4. waiting for more suggestions from the community...

## Why bitcoin
1. Bitcoin is the first blockchain, it is the chain with the highest degree of consensus and the highest security
2. Bitcoin ordinals protocol, storing all of the NFT data on the chain, it would not be lost forever
3. Bitcoin has the largest TVL, inscribing your project whitepaper on Bitcoin is very memorable and advantageous 

## Why qrpaper
1. qrpaper is the first project that helps users inscribe their whitepaper on Bitcoin using ordinals protocol
2. qrpaper optimized the NFT image generation technology, compressed the data size to the limit, it greatly reduced the gas
3. qrpaper use qrpaper.sats domain to sign every NFT to ensure no one can fake it
4. qrpaper split and visualized the whitepaper to qrcode, which has a beautiful style, it is easy to spread
5. qrpaper is governed by the community through qp-dao, it's a decentralized project

2. the bitcoin logo in the middle
3. the qrpaper logo in the bottom right corner
4. the serial number on the foot
